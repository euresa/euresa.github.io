	<h2><a href="Quantifying_Gerrymandering.pdf"> Sampling the Space of Possible NC Congressional Districting Plans </a></h2>

	As part of the Quantifying Gerrymandering project, I helped develop statistical simulations to sample redistricting plans for various states. 

	<h2><a href="Final_Project.pdf"> Numerical Methods for Stochastic Differential Equations </a></h2>
	
	I wrote a short primer on numerical methods for solving SDEs. 

	<h2><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/euresa/statistics/blob/master/Duke%20Coding%20Assignments/Python/Machine%20Learning/%28COMP%20671D%29%20Homework%201.ipynb"> Machine Learning Problem</a></h2>
	
	This is just an old problem from a machine learning homework I had while at Duke. I'm mainly putting it here to test if I can include Jupyter Notebook scripts on my website.
