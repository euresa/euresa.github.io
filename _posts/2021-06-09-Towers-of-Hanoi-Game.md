# Towers-of-Hanoi-Game

I've been learning a bit more about software engineering with Python and decided to write up a short Towers of Hanoi game that can be run from the terminal.
The code can be found [here.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/euresa/PythonProjects/blob/main/TowersOfHanoi/tower.py) 

To play the game, simply save the code to a python document on your computer, simply run the code!
