Hello! My name is Sam Eure and welcome to my site. I'm a recent graduate of Duke University where I studied Math/Statistics/CS and will be starting my PhD in Statistics at the University of Washington this Fall. 

I enjoy working on analytically complicated problems whose answers may help better society. One project I was heavily involved in as an undergraduate was the [Quantifying Gerrymandering Project](https://sites.duke.edu/quantifyinggerrymandering/quantifying-gerrymandering/) where I aided in the development statistical methods for identifying [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering). 

Although I have spent the last 6 years living, studying, and working in Durham, NC, I am originally from the Outer Banks (Kitty Hawk) of NC where I still enjoy surfing, kayaking, and spearfishing. Other interests of mine include rock climbing, hiking through, playing the guitar, reading, and spending time with friends.
