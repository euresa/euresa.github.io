	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>Hello! My name is Sam Eure and welcome to my site. I'm recently graduated from Duke University where I studied Math/Statistics/CS.  This fall, I'll be starting a PhD in Statistics at the University of Washington. 
	</p>

	<p>
	I enjoy working on analytically complicated problems whose answers may help better society. One project I was heavily involved in as an undergraduate was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2YfwpWFTDw">Quantifying Gerrymandering Project</a> where I aided in the development statistical methods for identifying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a>. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Although I have spent the last 6 years living, studying, and working in Durham, NC, I'm originally from the Outer Banks of NC where I still enjoy surfing, kayaking, and spearfishing. Other interests of mine include rock climbing, hiking, reading, playing the guitar, board games, cooking, and spending time with friends. When I'm able to, I also enjoy traveling.
