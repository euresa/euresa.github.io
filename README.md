# Personal Website/Blog

I've seen a lot of people with cool, simple personal websites/blogs linked to their githubs and I think it's a really cool idea! So, after looking at how other individuals have developed their code, I am creating my own website [here](https://euresa.github.io/).

The backend of the website is powered by Jekyll and a lot of the HTML I'm used was found on [Andrea Boscovik's Github](https://github.com/aboskovic21).
